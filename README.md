## How to play

* Can you find all the hidden instruments that are making a sound before the time is up?

* As soon as you are ready you click start, and then the timer is off. A sound will be heard from one of the instruments in the picture, 
  and if you find the right character that is playing that sound you get a point after clicking it.

* Want to play again? Just click restart and you can try and beat your own score!

* You can play the game without audio if needed. Just click mute in the top right corner and then click on the arrow by the timer for the  
  image of the character with the instrument you are looking for under the timer. The image is shown on the right hand side of the game screen.
